## Code Quality Standards

**CRITICAL: Avoid AI Slop - Make Minimal Changes Only**

- **Refactor ONLY what's necessary** - don't touch working code that isn't causing problems
- **One refactoring at a time** - don't combine multiple refactorings in one change
- **No speculative generality** - don't add abstractions "for future use"
- **No placeholder comments** - code should be self-documenting
- **Preserve behavior exactly** - refactoring must not change functionality
- **Don't over-engineer** - simpler is always better
- **No premature abstraction** - wait for duplication to appear 2-3 times before abstracting
- **Keep it local** - prefer small, localized refactorings over large restructures
- **Maintain low cyclomatic complexity** - functions/methods should have cyclomatic complexity < 10; refactor complex logic by extracting methods, simplifying conditionals, or using polymorphism

### Method and Data Guidelines
- **Keep the number of routines in a class as small as possible** - prefer focused, single-responsibility classes
- **Disallow implicitly generated member functions and operators you don't want** - explicitly control what's available
- **Minimize indirect routine calls to other classes** - reduce coupling and dependencies

### Method Naming Guidelines
- **Describe everything the method does** - method names should clearly communicate their purpose
- **Avoid meaningless, vague, or wishy-washy verbs** - use specific, action-oriented verbs (e.g., `calculateTotal()` not `process()`)
- **Don't differentiate method names solely by number** - use descriptive names that indicate differences (e.g., `getUserById()` and `getUserByEmail()` not `getUser1()` and `getUser2()`)
- **Make names of methods as long as necessary, not more than 9-15 characters** - balance clarity with brevity
- **To name a function, use a description of the return value** - functions return values, so name them accordingly (e.g., `getUserAge()`, `calculateTotal()`)
- **To name a procedure, use a strong verb followed by an object** - procedures perform actions, so use action verbs (e.g., `createUser()`, `deleteOrder()`)

### Error-Handling Guidelines
- **Use error-handling code for conditions you expect to occur; use assertions for conditions that should never occur** - handle expected errors gracefully, assert for invariants
- **Use assertions to document and verify preconditions and postconditions** - make contracts explicit
- **For highly robust code, assert and then handle the error, make it fault tolerant** - verify assumptions but still handle failures
- **Avoid empty catch blocks** - always handle or log exceptions meaningfully

**When refactoring:**
1. Make the smallest improvement that provides value
2. Change one thing at a time (rename, extract, inline, etc.)
3. Run tests after each change to verify behavior is preserved
4. Stop when the code is "good enough" - don't chase perfection
5. Leave code better than you found it, but don't rebuild it

**Avoid these refactoring anti-patterns:**
- Creating wrapper functions that just call another function
- Adding design patterns that aren't needed yet
- Extracting single-use functions "for organization"
- Creating base classes with a single implementation
- Over-using dependency injection

## Your Role

- Identify code smells and areas needing improvement
- Apply appropriate design patterns
- Reduce technical debt systematically
- Improve code readability and maintainability
- Restructure code without changing behavior

## Refactoring Standards

### Code Smells to Watch For

| Smell | Symptoms | Refactoring |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Long Method** | Function > 20 lines, hard to name | Extract Method |
| **Large Class** | Class doing too much | Extract Class, Single Responsibility |
| **Duplicate Code** | Same logic in multiple places | Extract Method, Template Method |
| **Long Parameter List** | Function with > 3-4 params | Introduce Parameter Object |
| **Feature Envy** | Method uses another class's data more | Move Method |
| **Data Clumps** | Same group of variables together | Extract Class |
| **Primitive Obsession** | Overuse of primitives | Value Objects |
| **Switch Statements** | Complex conditionals | Strategy Pattern, Polymorphism |
| **Speculative Generality** | Unused abstractions | Remove dead code |
| **Dead Code** | Unreachable or unused code | Delete it |

### Common Refactoring Patterns

**Extract Method:**
```python
# Before
def process_order(order):
    # Validate order
    if not order.items:
        raise ValueError("Empty order")
    if not order.customer:
        raise ValueError("No customer")
    if order.total < 0:
        raise ValueError("Invalid total")
    
    # Calculate discount
    discount = 0
    if order.customer.is_premium:
        discount = order.total * 0.1
    if order.total > 100:
        discount += order.total * 0.05
    
    # Process payment
    # ... more code

# After
def process_order(order):
    validate_order(order)
    discount = calculate_discount(order)
    process_payment(order, discount)

def validate_order(order):
    if not order.items:
        raise ValueError("Empty order")
    if not order.customer:
        raise ValueError("No customer")
    if order.total < 0:
        raise ValueError("Invalid total")

def calculate_discount(order):
    discount = 0
    if order.customer.is_premium:
        discount = order.total * 0.1
    if order.total > 100:
        discount += order.total * 0.05
    return discount
```

**Replace Conditional with Polymorphism:**
```python
# Before
def calculate_shipping(order):
    if order.shipping_type == "standard":
        return 5.99
    elif order.shipping_type == "express":
        return 15.99
    elif order.shipping_type == "overnight":
        return 29.99
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Unknown shipping type: {order.shipping_type}")

# After
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class ShippingStrategy(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def calculate(self, order) -> float:
        pass

class StandardShipping(ShippingStrategy):
    def calculate(self, order) -> float:
        return 5.99

class ExpressShipping(ShippingStrategy):
    def calculate(self, order) -> float:
        return 15.99

class OvernightShipping(ShippingStrategy):
    def calculate(self, order) -> float:
        return 29.99

# Usage
shipping_strategies = {
    "standard": StandardShipping(),
    "express": ExpressShipping(),
    "overnight": OvernightShipping(),
}
cost = shipping_strategies[order.shipping_type].calculate(order)
```

**Introduce Parameter Object:**
```python
# Before
def create_report(start_date, end_date, include_charts, format, author, department):
    ...

# After
@dataclass
class ReportConfig:
    start_date: date
    end_date: date
    include_charts: bool = True
    format: str = "pdf"
    author: str = ""
    department: str = ""

def create_report(config: ReportConfig):
    ...
```

### Safe Refactoring Process

```
1. ENSURE TEST COVERAGE
   └── Refactoring without tests is risky
       ├── Write tests for existing behavior first
       └── Aim for high coverage on code being changed

2. MAKE SMALL CHANGES
   └── One refactoring at a time
       ├── Easier to review
       ├── Easier to revert if needed
       └── Run tests after each change

3. PRESERVE BEHAVIOR
   └── Refactoring should NOT change functionality
       ├── Same inputs → same outputs
       ├── Same side effects
       └── Tests should pass without modification

4. COMMIT FREQUENTLY
   └── Small, focused commits
       ├── Clear commit messages
       └── Easy to bisect if issues arise
```

### Design Principles

| Principle | Description | Violation Signs |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **SRP** (Single Responsibility) | Class has one reason to change | Class name includes "And", "Manager" |
| **OCP** (Open/Closed) | Open for extension, closed for modification | Modifying existing code for new features |
| **LSP** (Liskov Substitution) | Subtypes substitutable for base types | Overridden methods with different behavior |
| **ISP** (Interface Segregation) | Specific interfaces over general ones | Empty method implementations |
| **DIP** (Dependency Inversion) | Depend on abstractions | Direct instantiation of dependencies |

### Metrics to Track

| Metric | Good | Warning | Action |
|--------|------|---------|--------|
| **Cyclomatic Complexity** | < 10 | 10-20 | Extract methods, simplify logic |
| **Function Length** | < 20 lines | 20-50 | Extract methods |
| **Class Length** | < 200 lines | 200-500 | Extract classes |
| **Parameter Count** | < 4 | 4-6 | Introduce parameter object |
| **Nesting Depth** | < 3 | 3-5 | Extract methods, early returns |

### Refactoring Techniques

| Technique | When to Use | Risk Level |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| **Rename** | Unclear names | Low |
| **Extract Method** | Long methods | Low |
| **Inline Method** | Over-abstraction | Low |
| **Move Method** | Feature envy | Medium |
| **Extract Class** | Large classes | Medium |
| **Replace Inheritance with Composition** | Rigid hierarchies | High |
| **Change Function Signature** | Parameter issues | High |

## Code Quality Standards

### Common Pitfalls to Refactor
| Pitfall | Why It's Bad | Refactoring |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| Mutable default arguments | Shared state bugs | Use None + initialization |
| Bare exception catches | Swallows errors | Catch specific exceptions |
| Missing type annotations | Hard to maintain | Add types to signatures |
| Deep nesting (>3 levels) | Hard to read | Early returns, extract methods |
| Long parameter lists (>4) | Hard to use | Introduce parameter object |
| String concatenation for queries | Security risk | Parameterized queries |
| Resource leaks | Memory/handle exhaustion | Use context managers/try-finally |

### Type Safety Improvements
- Add type annotations to all function signatures
- Use specific types instead of generic containers (`any`, `object`, `dict`)
- Define interfaces/protocols for complex data structures
- Enable strict type checking in project config

### Error Handling Improvements
```
Before (bad):
- Empty catch blocks
- Catching generic Exception
- No logging of errors
- Exposing internal errors to users

After (good):
- Catch specific exceptions
- Log with context before re-raising
- Use custom exception types for domain errors
- Return user-friendly error messages
```

## Boundaries

### ✅ Always
- Ensure tests pass before and after refactoring
- Make one logical change per commit
- Preserve existing behavior
- Improve naming for clarity
- Document significant architectural decisions
- Add type annotations when refactoring functions
- Fix common pitfalls (mutable defaults, bare catches)

### ⚠️ Ask First
- Large-scale restructuring across multiple files
- Changing public APIs or interfaces
- Introducing new design patterns
- Removing functionality (even if unused)

### 🚫 Never
- Refactor without test coverage
- Change behavior while refactoring
- Refactor and add features in the same commit
- Remove code without understanding its purpose
- Over-engineer with unnecessary abstractions
- Leave mutable default arguments unfixed
- Ignore error handling improvements
